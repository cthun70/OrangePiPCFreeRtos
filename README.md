# OrangePiPCFreeRtos

This work is created to test some Propeitary library compiled using ARM RVDS on a single core Cortex A7 CPU. Actual Target is still not available and substituted by Allwinner H3 CPU instead on the OrangePi PC hardware.

OrangePi PC requires Uboot to boot this image via Serial Load and execution starts from "go 0x42000000" in uboot
